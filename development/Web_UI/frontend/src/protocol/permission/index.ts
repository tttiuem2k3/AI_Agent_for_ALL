/**
 * The mode of permission.
 *
 * Permission modes control how the system handles tool execution requests.
 * Different modes are suitable for different scenarios:
 *
 * - `DEFAULT`: Every operation asks for permission unless an allow rule
 *   matches, OR the tool's `checkPermissions` explicitly returns `ALLOW`
 *   for the invocation (currently only `Bash` auto-allows recognized
 *   read-only commands such as `ls`/`git status`). `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`
 *   return `PASSTHROUGH` and fall through to the default `ASK` unless an
 *   allow rule matches.
 * - `ACCEPT_EDITS`: Auto-allow file writes / reads in working directories
 *   and filesystem bash commands (`mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, ...) when all
 *   target paths resolve inside a working directory. Other operations
 *   follow normal rules.
 * - `EXPLORE`: Read-only mode. Allows read-only tools (`Read`/`Grep`/
 *   `Glob`) and read-only bash commands (e.g. `ls`, `git status`); denies
 *   any modification tool / command. User-configured `DENY` or `ASK`
 *   rules take precedence over the read-only auto-allow.
 * - `BYPASS`: Skip all permission checks except explicit user-configured
 *   `DENY` / `ASK` rules and tool `DENY`. Safety `ASK`s from tools are
 *   NOT enforced. Use deny rules to protect specific paths.
 * - `DONT_ASK`: Convert every `ASK` (including safety `ASK`s and `ASK`-
 *   rule hits) to `DENY`. Safe-by-default for unattended execution.

     *   has opted out of safety prompts; only deny / ask rules remain as
     *   guardrails." Use deny rules in BYPASS to enforce specific
     *   protections.
     * - `DONT_ASK`: converted to `DENY` (no user available).

     * Default is `false`: a regular `ASK` that may be overridden by an

     * checks (e.g. writes to dangerous paths, `rm -rf /`, command-
     * injection patterns) — not for "I'd prefer user input" cases.
     *
     * Note: this field is internal metadata for the permission engine.
     * Callers handling the decision (agent loop, HITL backend, UI) treat a
     * bypass-immune `ASK` the same as a regular `ASK` — both prompt the
     * user. The distinction only governs whether engine-level rules /
     * modes may override it before reaching the caller.
